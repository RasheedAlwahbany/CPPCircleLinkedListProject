This is C++ Circular linked list project

# What is C++
C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

# What is Linked List
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

# What is Circular Linked List
The circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. In a circular linked list, the first node and the last node are connected to each other which forms a circle. There is no NULL at the end.
A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the first and the last nodes are also connected to each other to form a circle. There are basically two types of circular linked list: Circular Singly Linked List. Here, the address of the last node consists of the address of the first node.
